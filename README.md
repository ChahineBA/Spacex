# SpaceX API Data Collection Project

## Overview

This project aims to collect data from the SpaceX API to analyze various aspects of SpaceX launches, missions, and rockets. The data collected will be used for exploratory data analysis, visualization, and potentially for predictive modeling or insights generation. This project is part of the requirements for completing the IBM Applied Data Science certificate.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to gather comprehensive data on SpaceX launches, including details such as launch dates, mission outcomes, rocket specifications, payloads, and more. By collecting and analyzing this data, we aim to gain insights into SpaceX's operational patterns, mission success rates, rocket performance, and other relevant metrics.

## Project Components

### 1. Data Collection
- Utilize the SpaceX API to retrieve information on launches, rockets, payloads, and other relevant data.
- Implement data scraping techniques if necessary to gather additional information not available through the API.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Clean and preprocess the collected data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.
- Perform data transformation and feature engineering as needed for analysis.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics and distributions of the collected data.
- Visualize key metrics and trends related to SpaceX launches, missions, and rockets.

### 4. Insights Generation
- Extract actionable insights from the analyzed data to understand SpaceX's performance, mission success factors, and potential areas for improvement.
- Explore correlations between different variables and their impact on mission outcomes.

### 5. Documentation and Reporting
- Document the entire data collection process, data preprocessing steps, analysis techniques, and findings in a clear and concise manner.
- Create visualizations, summary tables, and reports to communicate the project's results effectively.

## Technologies Used

- Python: For data collection, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
- Requests library: For making HTTP requests to the SpaceX API.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and documentation.

## Project Deliverables

- Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code and analysis steps.
- README file providing project overview, objectives, methodologies, and technologies used.
- Visualizations, summary tables, and reports highlighting key findings and insights.
- Presentation slides summarizing the project for stakeholders.

## Conclusion

This project will provide valuable insights into SpaceX's activities, mission success rates, and rocket performance, contributing to our understanding of the commercial space industry. By leveraging data science techniques and tools, we aim to derive actionable insights that can inform decision-making and future research in this domain.
